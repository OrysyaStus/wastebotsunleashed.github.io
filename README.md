We extracted a sample of 40 littered Google Street View San Diego images for training and sample of a random sample of ~50,000 Google Street View images across San Diego, California for testing, processed the data, trained shape recognition and color recognition models, classified our images based on each model as littered/not littered, and designed an interactive website http://wastebotsunleased.github.io for visualizing which zip codes in San Diego are least and most littered. The goal is to engage public and government officials in keeping San Diego beautiful. This is a prototype and shows the potential of using data science for public benefit.
