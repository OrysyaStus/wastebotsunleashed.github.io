# Waste Bots Unleashed
###### Cleaning Up Litter. One Data Point at a Time.


## Challenge: Identification and Coding of Litter
An important step toward Keeping America Beautiful is to identify problems and educate the public about them. For this challenge, each team is asked to design and develop a software application that can take advantage of current computing technology to help code the varying levels of litter (1=no litter, 2=slightly littered, 3=littered, 4=extremely) in a community using images from Google Streets, and to create a local and national measure of litter. Each team is invited to think through the process of collecting, reviewing, and coding images, the organization of images, and the strategies to engage broader participation from local residents. 

## Product
We extracted a sample of 40 littered Google Street View San Diego images for training and sample of a random sample of ~50,000 Google Street View images across San Diego, California for testing, processed the data, trained shape recognition and color recognition models, classified our images based on each model as littered/not littered, and designed an interactive website http://wastebotsunleashed.github.io for visualizing which zip codes in San Diego are least and most littered. The goal is to engage public and government officials in keeping San Diego beautiful. This is a prototype and shows the potential of using data science for public benefit.
